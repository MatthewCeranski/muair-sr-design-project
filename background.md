# Design Inspiration

More than 135 million Americans live with polluted air, and disadvantaged communities are most affected by air pollution due to their proximity to freeways and industrial areas. Although there are lots of air quality monitoring tools available, the data outputs may not be well-understood by laypeople, so there is a need to raise environmental awareness by creating easily understandable air quality monitoring tools for disadvantaged communities in the United States. Our senior design group at Marquette University was tasked with designing and prototyping a solution to the rising concern of poor air quality. 

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets the standards for the way AQI is calculated and reported. They created threshold ranges for six different AQI categories and the corresponding colors. We are following the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM. Also, the EPA regulates six pollutants, which the AQI is calculated based on the concentrations of each: ozone, PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, NO2. We incorporated this information into our air quality monitoring system appropriately.


# About the Team

This team was comprised of four Marquette University Mechancial Engineers under the supervision of Dr. Somesh Roy. This project turned out to be heavily code based; Matthew and George took on the task of teaching themselves python. Gaby took a strong research role, providing design specifications for the team. David and Will took on the task of designing the housing for both the sensor and visualization.


# Warning

MUAIR is not a tested and calibrated device. While it aims to provide useful information about the local air quality, it cannot be used as a source of data for making decisions regarding health and wellness. This is an educational tool that aims to bring awareness to the environment that we live in. 


MUAIR requires some assembly. Here is a reminder for best practices associated with DIY projects:

•	ALWAYS wear proper personal protective equipment. This includes safety glasses, cut resistant gloves, and respirators. 

•	When working with aerosol materials (sprayable rubber, paint) work in a well-ventilated space. Avoid inhaling vapors.

•	Electrical equipment should never be handled while it is plugged in. Before touching any electrical component, unplug and leave untouched for 1-2 minutes. 

•	If soldering connections, be aware of hot soldering iron. Avoid use of lead solder. Soldier only in well-ventilated areas.
