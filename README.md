## Sensor Unit
The sensor unit contains the hardware for measuring air quality, including sensors and microcontrollers. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to deploy in various environments.


## Visual Unit
The visual unit is responsible for displaying the data collected by the sensor unit. It connects wirelessly to the sensor unit and shows real-time data on a screen.


## Setup Instructions
To get started, follow the instructions in the [sensor-assembly.md](sensor-unit/sensor-assembly.md) and [visual-assembly.md](visual-unit/visual-assembly.md) for assembling and setting up the units.
