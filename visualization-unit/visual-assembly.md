# Visual Unit: Assembly Instructions

## 1. 3D Print the Visualization Housing

Download the STL files and 3D models [here]().

These parts are not designed to be structural or waterproof on their own. Therefore, any common filament material can be used. The MUAIR team recommends PETG due to its UV resistance and relatively low cost.

If you are new to 3D printing, search for a tutorial based on your specific printer and slicing software. The MUAIR team used Bambu Studio with the preset profile for Bambu Labs PETG Basic.

- Slice and print these models at any point in your build process.
- Because the parts are not structural, you can experiment with slicing parameters to suit your needs.

### Visualization Housing Modification

There is a known clearance issue with the SD card slot on the Raspberry Pi. To resolve this, use a Dremel or other rotary tool to hollow out a **0.5 inch by 0.5 inch** square that is at least **0.15 inches deep** in the corresponding wall of the housing.

Refer to the reference image below for proper placement and dimensions.

## 2. Attach Smokestacks to the Visualization Housing

The visualization housing includes decorative smokestacks that need to be attached to the top of the unit.

To secure the smokestacks:

1. Mix a two-part clear epoxy on a sheet of cardboard.
2. Apply small dabs of the mixture to the ends of the smokestacks using toothpicks or Q-Tips.
3. Carefully insert the smokestacks into position, centered around the pre-cut holes on the top of the assembly.

Tip: Wear latex gloves to avoid getting epoxy on your hands. This also makes it easier to wipe off any excess.

Allow the epoxy to cure according to the manufacturer's instructions.

## 3. Paint the Visualization Housing (Optional)

Painting is optional but recommended for a more engaging visual experience.

The MUAIR team painted the visualization unit to reflect a realistic factory aesthetic. The more visually compelling the unit is, the more likely it is to spark curiosity and prompt reflection about air quality.

Feel free to be creativeâ€”make the visualization stand out and invite interpretation.
