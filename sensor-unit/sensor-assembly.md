# Sensor Unit: Assembly Instructions

## 1. 3D Print the Sensor Housing

🔗 **Download STL Files**: [Click here to access the 3D models and STL files](INSERT-LINK-HERE)

These parts are **not designed to be structural or waterproof on their own**, so you can print them with most common filament materials. The MUAIR team recommends **PETG** for its UV resistance and low cost.

If you are new to 3D printing, we suggest searching for tutorials tailored to your specific printer software. The MUAIR team used **Bambu Studio** with the preset profile for **Bambu Labs PETG Basic**.

- You can slice and print the parts at any time during the build process.
- Feel free to modify the model parameters as needed.

**Note**: In their current state, both the sensor housing and visualization housing **require modification** to fit internal components.

### Sensor Modification Notice

There is a **known clearance issue** with the sensor module near the screen side of the housing. Specifically, the **inner holding post blocks installation**. Use a Dremel or rotary tool to **remove the post**, leaving approximately **0.25"** remaining to retain structural stability.

## 2. Attach Plexiglass Viewport to Sensor Housing

The sensor housing requires a **2 ¾” x 1” acrylic cover** to be installed over the LCD viewport **before waterproofing**.

### 🛒 Buying Option:
You can purchase a pre-cut piece of clear acrylic in that size.

### DIY Cutting Option:
1. Use a ruler and fine-tipped Sharpie to mark a rectangle on the plastic cover of a larger acrylic sheet.
2. Cut carefully using a razor blade, acrylic scoring knife, or rotary tool.
3. You can always trim down the piece if it's slightly oversized.
4. **Exercise caution** when cutting.

### Attaching the Cover:
- Mix a **two-part clear epoxy** on cardboard.
- Use toothpicks or Q-tips to apply small dabs of epoxy to the recessed edge of the viewport.
- **Remove the protective plastic film** from the acrylic before applying epoxy.
- Tip: Wear **latex gloves** to avoid mess and for easier cleanup.

 **Cure Time**: Follow the epoxy manufacturer's instructions for drying and curing.

## 3. Waterproof the Sensor Housing

To protect internal components, the sensor housing must be waterproofed.

- Use a **sprayable clear rubber coating**.
- **Tape off** the sensor housing as shown in the assembly guide.
- Spray according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

> **DO NOT spray the bottom of the sensor housing.**  
> This area includes vents critical to sensor function — blocking them will reduce accuracy.

Spray all **other sides** of the housing.
